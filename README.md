# Version
This is currently the first iteration of the game : v0.0

# Design & Constraints
This game was developed in Python with pygame, thus you have to have this library and a few others installed.
If you don't have Python, no problem : the "Delegation.7z" file contains an automatic launcher called "main" that will install Python and the required packages and automatically launch the game.
The game has, for the moment, no graphic options, and is designed to run in a 1500x1000 window. So be sure to adapt your screen resolution to make it run.

# Future developments
- A full screen option adapted to all resolutions
- A women and a men circuit. For the moment, all world records are set to men's ones, but in-game names can be whether men or women, so basically it is just a "humanity" record for now.
- Improve the graphics : this first version is graphically poor on purpose, its goal is just to illustrate the performances of your athletes and to show the concept of the game to everyone.

# Discord
I'm really eager for some feedback so don't hesitate to come and join the dedicated Discord to :
- Report some bugs
- Discuss some improvements, whether about the interface, the concept, the physical model of events, the influence of characteristics etc...
